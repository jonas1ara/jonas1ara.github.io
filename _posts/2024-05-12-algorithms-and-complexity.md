title: Algorithms and complexity ðŸ“ˆ
description:  The algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions that will be executed in a certain order to obtain the desired output. Algorithms are usually created independently of the underlying languages, that is, an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.

## Characteristics of an algorithm

Not all procedures can be called algorithms. An algorithm must have the following characteristics:

- **Unambiguous**: It must be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and its inputs/outputs must be clear and must lead to a single meaning
- **Input**: An algorithm must have zero or more inputs.
- **Output**: An algorithm must have one or more outputs.
