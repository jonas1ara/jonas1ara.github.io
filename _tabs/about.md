## Hi there üëã

My name is Jonas Lara, I am originally from Mexico üá≤üáΩ but now I am currently moving to the USA üá∫üá∏

## These days

After working for a couple of years in the automotive industry as a mechatronics technician and stopping my career as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, **in 2021 I decide to resume my university studies.** I spent two years studying engineering in Artificial Intelligence but for personal reasons **I have decided to move to a computer science degree at the SUAyED of the UNAM in Mexico.**

I was at the [National Polytechnic Institute](https://twitter.com/IPN_MX) for 2 years and although I did not finish my studies there, **I had two professors who influenced me to become a researcher of the highest level and that is my goal now.**

To achieve my goal, patience and discipline are necessary, so the next step to achieve it is to go through the best public education institutions in my country to the best private technological education institution in the world, [MIT](https://twitter.com/MIT).

But before becoming a researcher I have to work to live, and currently work as a .NET developer, **all the programming knowledge I have is acquired self-taught and that makes me feel so incredible.** Finally, I have to tell you that I am an open-source contributor on small projects made with C and F#, am in love with the F# programming language (the vision of its creator [Don Syme](https://twitter.com/dsymetweets) just blows my mind) **and am currently looking to contribute to the F# compiler, wish me luck üçÄ**

## Past

I have been involved in the world of the automotive industry for many years, starting sometime around 2015-2016 or so. I was part of the [Mexican Dual Training Model](https://twitter.com/ModeloDualMX/status/834821876618629120) through the high school in [Tlaxcala](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlaxcala) where I spent a year on campus and trained for two years in an automotive company in [Puebla](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla), after graduating as a technician specialized in mechatronics, I worked for 6 years in the industry where **I learned about various automation processes and acquired skills such as PLC programming, robots programming, CNC machining, electrical installations, electrical control, etc.** For a while I thought this would be the rest of my life, but I'm proof that a person's interests change.

_"**No whining, at Microsoft there will only be solvers and no complainers, if you don't accept the new vision, it's time for you to move on.**"_

- _**Satya Nadella**_

In 2020, after the covid-19 quarantine, I decided to leave the automotive industry to follow my convictions. **I faced a lot of ridicule and complaints for leaving my professional career**, but that never mattered to me, in my life there will only be solvers and no complainants, so I just didn't stop, and just keep going.

The reason I decided to change industries in my professional career was that **I believe that humanity has reached where thanks to computer science**, if we can accurately map and track confirmed, suspected and recovered cases during a pandemic and do masterful data analysis to develop vaccines in record times, it has been thanks to the advance in the development of computer sciences where mathematics comes into play. **I think so that Artificial Intelligence is the most advanced and profound version where computer science and mathematics come together**, and I will dedicate the rest of my life to understanding it, improving it and helping to evolve it.

You may believe that I am someone competent who has managed to advance only through my efforts, but that is far from the truth, **I have been supported and tolerated not only economically but also emotionally by my mother Ana, my father Oscar, my brother Ian and by my wife Kelly ‚ù§Ô∏è**. So well, this is my background I love to share the knowledge that I acquire in computer science; I hope you enjoy this journey as much as I do.

All the best  üòä
