Hi there 👋, My name is Jonas Lara, I am originally from Mexico but now I am currently living in the USA.

## These days

Self-taught and passionate about programming, I work as a .NET developer while pursuing my goal of becoming a researcher and entrepreneur. I previously worked in the automotive industry but found my true passion in computer science. I contribute to open-source projects in .NET and I am currently a contributor to the F# compiler. In addition to coding, I am an avid marathon runner, always striving for new personal bests.

## Past

I have been involved in the world of the automotive industry for many years, starting sometime around 2015-2016 or so. I was part of the [Mexican Dual Training Model](https://twitter.com/ModeloDualMX/status/834821876618629120) through the high school, after graduating as a technician specialized in mechatronics, I worked for 6 years in the industry where I learned about various automation processes and acquired skills such as PLC programming, robots programming, CNC machining, electrical installations, electrical control, etc. For a while I thought this would be the rest of my life, but I'm proof that a person's interests change.

_"**No whining — at Microsoft there will only be problem-solvers, not complainers. If you don’t accept the new vision, don’t stay; it’s time for you to move on.**"_

- _**Satya Nadella**_

In 2020, after the covid-19 quarantine, I decided to leave the automotive industry to follow my convictions. I faced a lot of ridicule and complaints for leaving my professional career, but that never mattered to me, **in my life there will only be solvers and no complainants, so I just didn't stop, and just keep going.**

The reason I decided to change industries in my professional career is that I believe humanity has advanced thanks to computer science. If we are able to accurately map and track confirmed, suspected, and recovered cases during a pandemic, and perform masterful data analysis to develop vaccines in record time, it is because of progress in computer science, where mathematics plays a key role. I believe that Artificial Intelligence is the most advanced and profound point where computer science and mathematics converge, and I will dedicate the rest of my life to understanding it, improving it, and helping it evolve.

You may believe that I am someone competent who has managed to advance only through my efforts, but that is far from the truth, **I have been supported and tolerated not only economically but also emotionally by my mother, my father, my brother and by my wife**. So well, this is my background I love to share the knowledge that I acquire in computer science; I hope you enjoy this journey as much as I do.

All the best  😊

AJLC
